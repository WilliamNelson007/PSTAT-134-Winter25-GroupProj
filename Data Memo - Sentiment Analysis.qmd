Your final project is intended to showcase your analytical abilities and model-building skills on a dataset of your choosing. Your memo should be written in the form of a short paper; if you've already obtained your data, you can include code or figures, but you are not required to. Your memo should answer all of the following:

<https://neptune.ai/blog/10-nlp-projects> Is where we got the project Idea

<https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/> 1996-2023 amazon reviews with multiple categories

<https://github.com/scrapehero-code/amazon-review-api> How to create an Amazon review API

### **An overview of your dataset**

1.  What does it include?

    -   `Toys and Games` is a dataset that contains Amazon review data spanning from 1996-2023 in their toys and games category. This will be used if we are not able to use an API. The dataset includes:

        -   **Review Text**: Written feedback from customers.

        -   **Star Ratings**: Numerical ratings of products (1â€“5 scale).

        -   **Helpful Votes**: Number of votes indicating how helpful a review is.

        -   **Verified Purchase**: Boolean indicating whether the reviewer purchased the product.

        -   **Timestamp**: When the review was written.

        -   **Product ID (ASIN)**: A unique identifier for each product

2.  Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source. If you plan on creating a web scraper or using an API, describe your plans.

    -   Our plan is to attempt to use an Amazon API to pull rating/review data directly.
    -   If the API does not workout, we will use the `Toys and Games` Amazon dataset. The dataset is being downloading from a [github repository](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/).
